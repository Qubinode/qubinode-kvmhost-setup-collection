## CI/CD Pipeline Fix - 2023-10-05

**Issue:** Pipeline was exiting during pruning phase despite successful tests

**Solution:** Modified molecule test command to use `--no-destroy` flag

**Reasoning:**
- The molecule.yml configuration already includes cleanup and destroy steps in its test sequence
- Running `molecule destroy` after `molecule test` was redundant and causing premature cleanup
- Using `--no-destroy` allows the scenario's built-in cleanup process to handle environment cleanup

**Impact:**
- Prevents pipeline from exiting during pruning phase
- Maintains proper test environment cleanup through scenario sequence
- Reduces redundant operations in the CI/CD pipeline
