## Collection Installation Issue

### Problem
The CI pipeline is failing to install collections from Ansible Galaxy due to API access issues.

### Proposed Solutions
1. **Add Galaxy Token (D1)**
   - Store token in GitHub Secrets
   - Modify pipeline to use token for authentication
   - Quickest solution to unblock development

2. **Local Collection Cache (D2)**
   - Create local cache of required collections
   - More reliable and faster builds
   - Requires additional setup effort

### Decision
We will implement the Galaxy token solution first to unblock development, while considering the local cache approach for future optimization.

### Implementation Steps
1. Add Galaxy token to GitHub Secrets as `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_TOKEN`
   - Go to GitHub repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `ANSIBLE_GALAXY_TOKEN`
   - Value: [Your Galaxy API token]
2. Modify CI pipeline to use the token [COMPLETED]
3. Test collection installation
   - Push changes to trigger pipeline
   - Verify collection installation succeeds
   - Check logs for any warnings or errors

### Future Considerations
- Implement local collection caching for faster builds
- Monitor Galaxy API reliability
- Consider mirroring critical collections
