## Pipeline Fix - Community.General Version Issue

**Date:** [Current Date]
**Issue:** Pipeline failing on Process install dependency map for community.general collection
**Root Cause:** Version constraint >=6.0.0,<7.0.0 was too restrictive and causing API resolution issues
**Solution:** Updated to exact version 10.2.0 which is known to work locally
**Impact:** Ensures consistent collection version across environments
**Decision Record:**
- Architect (A): Recommended pinning to exact version for stability
- Developer 1 (D1): Verified local working version
- Developer 2 (D2): Implemented version change in requirements.yml
