# Development Log

## Initial Analysis

### Inventory File Assessment
The inventory from `qubinode_navigator` provides several key configurations:
- KVM host setup variables
- System user configuration
- Storage configuration (LVM)
- Required packages list
- Network and DNS settings

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Architect (A)
- Responsible for overall system design
- Infrastructure decisions
- Integration patterns

### Developer 1 (D1)
- Implementation of core functionality
- Testing framework
- Code quality

### Developer 2 (D2)
- Containerization
- CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation

## Flags to Address

### --refactor
Status: In Progress
Owner: D1

Developer 1's Analysis:
1. Code Structure Issues:
   - Variable validation is scattered
   - Conditional logic could be simplified
   - Package management could be modularized
   - Network configuration needs better organization

2. Proposed Refactoring:
   ```yaml
   # Proposed structure
   tasks/
     â”œâ”€â”€ main.yml                 # Main orchestration
     â”œâ”€â”€ validation/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.yml            # Validation orchestration
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ variables.yml       # Variable validation
     â”‚   â””â”€â”€ prerequisites.yml   # System prerequisites
     â”œâ”€â”€ setup/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.yml           # Setup orchestration
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ packages.yml       # Package management
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ libvirt.yml        # Libvirt configuration
     â”‚   â””â”€â”€ networking.yml     # Network setup
     â””â”€â”€ configuration/
         â”œâ”€â”€ main.yml           # Configuration orchestration
         â”œâ”€â”€ shell.yml          # Shell configuration
         â”œâ”€â”€ cockpit.yml        # Cockpit setup
         â””â”€â”€ remote.yml         # Remote access setup
   ```

3. Improvements Needed:
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add input validation for all variables
   - Modularize network configuration
   - Improve role dependencies management
   - Add proper documentation for each task file

### --add-tests
Status: In Progress
Owner: D1

Testing Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   ```yaml
   # molecule/default/verify.yml
   - name: Verify kvmhost setup
     hosts: all
     tasks:
       - name: Verify required packages
         ansible.builtin.package_facts:
           manager: auto
         register: pkg_facts

       - name: Assert required packages are installed
         assert:
           that: item in pkg_facts.packages
           fail_msg: "Package {{ item }} is not installed"
         loop: "{{ required_rpm_packages }}"

       - name: Verify libvirt configuration
         stat:
           path: "/var/lib/libvirt/images"
         register: libvirt_dir

       - name: Assert libvirt directory exists
         assert:
           that: libvirt_dir.stat.exists
   ```

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test with provided inventory
   - Validate network configuration
   - Check storage pool creation
   - Verify user permissions

3. Test Scenarios:
   - Basic KVM host setup
   - Network bridge configuration
   - Storage pool management
   - User access control
   - Cockpit integration

### --dockerize
Status: In Progress
Owner: D2

Developer 2's Analysis:

1. Containerization Strategy:
```dockerfile
# Dockerfile for testing and development
FROM rockylinux:9

# Install required packages
RUN dnf install -y \
    ansible \
    python3-pip \
    libvirt-devel \
    && dnf clean all

# Install Ansible Galaxy requirements
COPY requirements.yml /requirements.yml
RUN ansible-galaxy install -r /requirements.yml

# Set up test environment
WORKDIR /ansible
COPY . /ansible/

# Default command
CMD ["ansible-playbook", "tests/test.yml"]
```

2. Container Usage Scenarios:
   - Development environment
   - CI/CD testing
   - Role validation
   - Integration testing

3. Multi-stage Build Approach:
   ```dockerfile
   # Build stage for testing
   FROM rockylinux:9 as tester
   RUN dnf install -y ansible python3-pip
   COPY . /ansible/
   WORKDIR /ansible
   RUN ansible-lint roles/

   # Production stage
   FROM rockylinux:9
   COPY --from=tester /ansible /ansible
   ```

### --diagram
Status: In Progress
Owner: A

Architect's Analysis:
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[KVMHost Setup Collection] --> B[kvmhost_setup]
    A --> C[edge_hosts_validate]
    A --> D[swygue_lvm]
    
    B --> B1[Libvirt Setup]
    B --> B2[Network Config]
    B --> B3[Storage Setup]
    B --> B4[User Config]
    
    C --> C1[FS Validation]
    C --> C2[Package Validation]
    C --> C3[RHSM Validation]
    
    D --> D1[LVM Precheck]
    D --> D2[LVM Deploy]
    
    B1 --> E[KVM Environment]
    B2 --> E
    B3 --> E
    B4 --> E
```

Key Components:
1. kvmhost_setup: Core role for KVM host configuration
   - Handles libvirt setup, networking, storage, and user configuration
   - Critical for establishing the virtualization environment

2. edge_hosts_validate: Validation role
   - Ensures system requirements are met
   - Validates filesystem, packages, and RHSM configuration
   - Acts as a prerequisite checker

3. swygue_lvm: Storage management role
   - Manages LVM configuration
   - Handles storage deployment
   - Integrates with kvmhost_setup for storage pools

Integration Points:
- All roles can use the provided inventory for testing
- Roles are designed to be modular but interdependent
- Clear separation of concerns between validation, setup, and storage management

### --add-github-action
Status: In Progress

      - name: Create Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1

```

Key Improvements:
