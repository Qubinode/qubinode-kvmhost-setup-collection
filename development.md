## CI/CD and Local Testing Configuration

### Decision: Containerization Strategy

**Architect (A):**
- For CI/CD pipelines, we will use Docker as it is widely supported across CI platforms
- For local development on RHEL systems, we will use Podman as configured in molecule/default/molecule.yml
- The same container image (docker.io/rockylinux/rockylinux:9-ubi-init) will be used in both environments for consistency

**Developer 1 (D1):**
- The current molecule.yml configuration is optimal for local development
- Podman provides better integration with RHEL systems
- No changes needed to the existing Molecule configuration

**Developer 2 (D2):**
- Agree with using Docker in CI/CD
- The current setup allows seamless switching between Docker and Podman
- The Dockerfile in molecule/default/ will be used for both environments

### Implementation Details

1. CI/CD pipelines will use Docker as the container runtime
2. Local development on RHEL will use Podman with the current molecule.yml configuration
3. The same container image will be used in both environments
4. GitHub Actions workflows will be configured to use Docker
