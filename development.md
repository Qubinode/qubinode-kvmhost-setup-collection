## RHEL 9 Compatibility

### Architect (A)

As the architect, I've reviewed the repository and identified the following areas that need to be addressed for RHEL 9 compatibility:

1.  **Package Dependencies:** The `required_rpm_pakcages` variable in `roles/kvmhost_setup/defaults/main.yml` had a typo and included some deprecated packages. I've corrected the typo to `required_rpm_packages`, replaced `yum-utils` with `dnf-utils`, removed `iptables-services`, and added `firewalld`, `podman`, and `container-selinux`.
2.  **Distribution-Specific Logic:** The `roles/kvmhost_setup/tasks/rocky_linux.yml` file was specific to Rocky Linux. I've modified the `when` condition in `roles/kvmhost_setup/tasks/main.yml` to include RHEL, updated the package group to `@Server`, and removed the `linux-system-roles.cockpit` role include because cockpit is already installed in the main task file.
3.  **Ansible Lint Errors:** The ansible-lint tool reported errors about missing FQCNs for `virt_net` and `virt_pool` modules. I've added the `community.libvirt` FQCN to the module calls in `roles/kvmhost_setup/tasks/bridge_interface.yml` and `roles/kvmhost_setup/tasks/storage_pool.yml`.

These changes should ensure that the Ansible collection is compatible with RHEL 9.

### Developer 1 (D1)

As Developer 1, I've implemented the changes proposed by the architect. I've carefully reviewed the code and made the necessary modifications to the files. I've also tested the changes locally to ensure they are working as expected.

### Developer 2 (D2)

As Developer 2, I've reviewed the changes made by Developer 1 and agree with the approach. I've also checked the ansible-lint output and confirmed that the errors have been resolved.
